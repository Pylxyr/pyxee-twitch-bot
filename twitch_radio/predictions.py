"""!predict — a thin state wrapper around Twitch's native Predictions API
(mirrors how !poll wraps native Polls in components/stream_info.py). Twitch
handles the channel-points payout itself; this only needs to track the
current prediction's outcome-id -> title mapping so `channel.prediction.end`
can announce a friendly result instead of a bare outcome id.

The actual `create`/`end` API calls are injected as callbacks, so this class
needs no Twitch API knowledge and is fully testable with fakes."""
