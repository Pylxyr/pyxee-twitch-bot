"""The public /commands page: every public command, organised into tabs.

Built from commands_reference.COMMANDS, the configured prefix, the mods'
custom commands and their counters, and cached for a short time by
handlers/live.py. It shows every public=True command exactly like chat's
own !commands does, just with full descriptions instead of a terse
pipe-separated line.

No per-request input feeds this — only owner/moderator-controlled data. The data is still embedded as JSON
and rendered client-side as text rather than markup (see commands.js's
escapeHtml) as a second layer of defence.
