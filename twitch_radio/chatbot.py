"""Twitch chat bot — connection, auth and message plumbing. The features
themselves live in services (automod.py, economy.py, customcommands.py) with
thin command layers in twitch_radio/components/*.

Built against twitchio 3.x's EventSub-based Bot (not the old IRC-token
pattern from twitchio 2.x).

Auth model: Twitch's "Installed Chatbot" pattern — one bot account (made a
moderator in your channel) with a User Access Token carrying
`user:read:chat` + `user:write:chat`. Moderator status satisfies the
ChatMessageSubscription requirement without a separate broadcaster-side
`channel:bot` grant.

One-time OAuth setup is required before chat commands work — TwitchIO's
built-in web server listens on http://localhost:4343 and persists whatever
token you authorize (see load_tokens/save_tokens). Full walkthrough in
README.md; short version:

  1. Start the bot once with TWITCH_CLIENT_ID/SECRET/BOT_ID/OWNER_ID set.
  2. On a remote host, tunnel the port first:
     `ssh -L 4343:localhost:4343 <user>@<host>`
  3. In a browser, logged in as the BOT's own account:
     http://localhost:4343/oauth?scopes=user:read:chat+user:write:chat+user:bot+moderator:manage:chat_messages+moderator:read:followers+moderator:manage:shoutouts+moderator:manage:banned_users&force_verify=true
  4. In a SEPARATE browser session, logged in as the BROADCASTER's account:
     http://localhost:4343/oauth?scopes=channel:bot+channel:read:subscriptions+bits:read+clips:edit+channel:manage:polls+channel:manage:predictions+channel:read:hype_train&force_verify=true

  Reusing the same logged-in session for steps 3 and 4 is the most common
  way this goes wrong — Twitch authorizes whichever account is currently
  logged in, with no error either way. See `_log_token_diagnostics` below.

  Tokens save to TWITCH_TOKEN_FILE (default: data/twitch_tokens.json) and
  reload automatically on future starts.

event_message() filters the bot's own messages via `chatter.id ==
self.bot_id` (ChatMessage has no `.echo`-style attribute), then hands every
other message to the chat feed, the economy and AutoMod as one ChatEvent.

Every feature below is gated by its own toggle (default off — see
toggles.py), even though the scopes above already cover all of them, so
turning a toggle on later never needs touching OAuth again. Each also
degrades independently if its scope is missing: a sticky flag logs the
failure once and stops retrying, rather than erroring or spamming the log.

  moderator:manage:chat_messages (bot)     -> filter_delete_enabled actually
                                               deleting a flagged message
  moderator:manage:banned_users (bot)      -> filter_timeout_enabled (timeouts
                                               after repeated violations)
  moderator:read:followers (bot)           -> !followage, follow alerts
  moderator:manage:shoutouts (bot)         -> !so, auto-shoutout on raid
  channel:read:subscriptions (broadcaster) -> sub alerts
  bits:read (broadcaster)                  -> cheer alerts
  clips:edit (broadcaster)                 -> !clip
  channel:manage:polls (broadcaster)       -> !poll
  channel:manage:predictions (broadcaster) -> !predict
  channel:read:hype_train (broadcaster)    -> Hype Train alerts

Follow/sub/cheer/raid/Hype-Train alerts and auto-shoutout-on-raid are all
gated by one toggle, alerts_enabled (off by default) — see
components/alerts.py. Raid detection needs no extra scope (channel.raid is
public); the shoutout still needs moderator:manage:shoutouts, so a raid can
announce without a shoutout if only that one scope is missing.

!duel/!gamble (gated by their own toggles) and !predict/!poll/!queue/
!giveaway (mod-initiated, no toggle — same precedent as !addcom) round out
engagement; !quote and !8ball need no scope or toggle at all. See each
service module (duels.py, predictions.py, queue.py, giveaway.py, quotes.py,
eightball.py, counters.py) for how each actually works.
